High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- Need to add a housekeeping/purge function to get rid of "deleted" (i.e. records marked with a
    deleted date but still extant in the database) relationships, and another one for persistable
    objects. Probably constrained to current project.

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.

- DQ checking and issues system


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

- TODO NEXT: Issues Log Editor form and database 

- TODO SECOND: Move "Role" under "Care setting" in the project tree, refactor the update notification,
    remove the "lists" from the top of the Care Setting and Role editors. Consider whether to
    handle Care setting/role relationships using a relationship table or a foreign key relationship
    with LocationID in a Role.

- TODO: Add "About" screen (Hannah to provide some content)

- TODO: Integrate Sharif's system/function editor

- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
