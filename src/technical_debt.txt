High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- Need to add a housekeeping/purge function to get rid of "deleted" (i.e. records marked with a
    deleted date but still extant in the database) relationships, and another one for persistable
    objects. Probably constrained to current project.

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Library including "Condition" editor/maintenance facility, and integration with the graphical
    editors (e.g. clone an existing hazard into a new context when making a bowtie from a new
    process model)

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.

- DQ checking and issues system


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

- TODO NEXT: Get rid of the processes list from the ProcessEditor. It should be a single-object editor.

- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.



Done (Design or implementation decisions)

- Do we need the "Bowtie Diagram" relationships ?  Yes we do, but the user doesn't need to see
    them. "Diagram" management class relationships suppressed in the UI. "Connection*" class
    and anything added manually are displayed.
