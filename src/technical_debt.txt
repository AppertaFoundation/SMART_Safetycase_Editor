NOT FOR MARCH:

- TODO: Modifications inside the graphical editors:
    - TODO: See if it is possible to auto-wrap the text in boxes in the graphical editors
    - Auto set hazard and root system names
    - Auto-create hazard and root system
- TODO: Look at putting in a check routine to cascade deletes... maybe. Uncontrolled
    that could accidentally wipe out an entire project and safe rules will be tricky.
- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
- TODO: "Undelete" and housekeeping functions from main menu
- TODO: DQ checking and issues system
- TODO: Library functions and object copy/paste
- TODO: Project tree display management is a serious mess. Refactor.


Functional

- BUGFIX: There are some cases where the graphical editor buttons don't work. But it
    is intermittent. Might be a problem with the notification system.

- TODO: Make a smart_new3 with a fresh database in it, plus a "refresh" copy of the
    fresh database to replace one that has become cluttered up with demo content

- TODO: Reports
