High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.



NOT FOR MARCH:

- TODO: Modifications inside the graphical editors:
    - TODO: See if it is possible to auto-wrap the text in boxes in the graphical editors
- TODO: Look at putting in a check routine to cascade deletes... maybe. Uncontrolled
    that could accidentally wipe out an entire project and safe rules will be tricky.
- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
- TODO: "Undelete" and housekeeping functions from main menu
- TODO: DQ checking and issues system
- TODO: Library functions and object copy/paste


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

    BUGFIX: Hazard edit and save without changing name. Can (observed once with
        re-edited and re-saved instance using the same instance of the hazard
        editor) result in a second entry for the hazard in the project tree.
        Database updates are OK.

- TODO NEXT: Integrate Sharif's system/function editor.

    - UI update needs more testing

        - Full edit set
            - Add nodes
            - Delete nodes
            - More renames

    - SystemFunctionEditor also from project tree. No "Delete". "OK" and "Cancel" 
       are fine. Have "Save" for when viewed from tree. 

    - Full system/subsystem/function/subfunction edit via graphics, save and test

- TODO: Reports

- TODO: Make a central registry of open editor forms that can be used for notifications
    - including updates, and things like the "Save All" below.

- TODO: Find a "disk" icon and add a "Save All" function to the main menu
    to the left of "File". And put "Save All..." tool-tip on it. Save all function
    interrogates open UI forms and "clicks save" for the user

- TODO: Link editor link type list - Hannah to provide RelationshipSemantics list
    - TODO: Make sure the RelationshipSemantics is implemented and works for the 
            Link editor.
