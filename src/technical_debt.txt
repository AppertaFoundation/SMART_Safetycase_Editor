High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.



NOT FOR MARCH:

- TODO: Modifications inside the graphical editors:
    - TODO: See if it is possible to auto-wrap the text in boxes in the graphical editors
- TODO: Look at putting in a check routine to cascade deletes... maybe. Uncontrolled
    that could accidentally wipe out an entire project and safe rules will be tricky.
- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
- TODO: "Undelete" and housekeeping functions from main menu
- TODO: DQ checking and issues system
- TODO: Library functions and object copy/paste


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

- TODO NEXT: Integrate Sharif's system/function editor.
    - UI update needs refactoring/testing
    - Refactor tree representation - make it work like "Hazard" with its dependents

    - System Create-from-editor-form database create cast error (probably 
        GraphCellId being assumed to be an int)

    - Replace "Discard" with "Delete". See also refactoring UI update because the
        refresh blows up with a ClassCastException at SmartProject.java:690 currently.

    - SystemFunctionEditor also from project tree. No "Delete". "OK" and "Cancel" 
       are fine. Have "Save" for when viewed from tree. 

    - Full system/subsystem/function/subfunction edit via graphics, save and test

- TODO: Reports
