High-level

- Need to add a housekeeping/purge function to get rid of "deleted" (i.e. records marked with a
    deleted date but still extant in the database) relationships, and another one for persistable
    objects. Probably constrained to current project.

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Library including "Condition" editor/maintenance facility, and integration with the graphical
    editors (e.g. clone an existing hazard into a new context when making a bowtie from a new
    process model)

- Reports

- DQ checking and issues system


Functional

- Bowtie editor update UI after save

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

- Do we need the "Bowtie Diagram" relationships ?

- Process editing

-
