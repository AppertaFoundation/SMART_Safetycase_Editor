High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- Need to add a housekeeping/purge function to get rid of "deleted" (i.e. records marked with a
    deleted date but still extant in the database) relationships, and another one for persistable
    objects. Probably constrained to current project.

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.

- DQ checking and issues system


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms


- TODO: Look at putting in a check routine to cascade deletes... maybe. Uncontrolled
    that could accidentally wipe out an entire project and safe rules will be tricky.

- TODO: Rename "Process" to "Care Process"

- TODO: Double-click on a linked Hazard in the table in Process Step Detail form should launch
    the Hazard editor. This will require making the ProcessStepDetail form a Persistable
    Editor and running it in an ExternalEditorView (as the Hazard Editor is from the
    graphical process step popup menu), because at the moment it is displayed as a modal
    dialog so wouldn't allow user interaction with the displayed hazard form.

- TODO: Modifications inside the graphical editors:
    - TODO: See if it is possible to auto-wrap the text in boxes in the graphical editors
    - TODO: See about a single block of colour and no gradient by default in process editor
    - TODO: Default shape colours in process editor (yellow for decision, blue for activity)


- TODO: Reports

- TODO: Integrate Sharif's system/function editor

- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
