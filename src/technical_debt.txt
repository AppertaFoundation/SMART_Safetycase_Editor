High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.



NOT FOR MARCH:

- TODO: Modifications inside the graphical editors:
    - TODO: See if it is possible to auto-wrap the text in boxes in the graphical editors
- TODO: Look at putting in a check routine to cascade deletes... maybe. Uncontrolled
    that could accidentally wipe out an entire project and safe rules will be tricky.
- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
- TODO: "Undelete" and housekeeping functions from main menu
- TODO: DQ checking and issues system
- TODO: Library functions and object copy/paste


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

    BUGFIX: Hazard edit and save without changing name. Can (observed once with
        re-edited and re-saved instance using the same instance of the hazard
        editor) result in a second entry for the hazard in the project tree.
        Database updates are OK.


- TODO: Reports

- TODO NEXT: Views of hazards, plus counts. Accepted, "unacceptable", "unacceptable but
    accepted due to clinical benefit". "Unacceptable" is residual rating (if present) > 3
    (put this in as a configurable property for now). "Accepted due to clinical benefit"
    is Hazard.clinicalJustification != null.

- TODO: Link editor link type list - Hannah to provide RelationshipSemantics list
    - TODO: Make sure the RelationshipSemantics is implemented and works for the 
            Link editor.
