High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- Need to add a housekeeping/purge function to get rid of "deleted" (i.e. records marked with a
    deleted date but still extant in the database) relationships, and another one for persistable
    objects. Probably constrained to current project.

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Library including "Condition" editor/maintenance facility, and integration with the graphical
    editors (e.g. clone an existing hazard into a new context when making a bowtie from a new
    process model)

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.

- DQ checking and issues system


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

- TODO NEXT: Get rid of the processes list from the ProcessEditor. It should be a single-object editor.
    Make SingleProcessEditorForm a persistable editor and have that called when user selects a process
        from the tree. Will need to implement populator for process details *and* process steps but only
        allow process step description to be edited from the form. Implement the handler for the "Process
        Editor..." button to launch the ProcessGraphicalEditor (just like the BowtieGraphicalEditor is
        launched from a button in the Hazard editor form)

- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.



Done (Design or implementation decisions)

- Do we need the "Bowtie Diagram" relationships ?  Yes we do, but the user doesn't need to see
    them. "Diagram" management class relationships suppressed in the UI. "Connection*" class
    and anything added manually are displayed.
