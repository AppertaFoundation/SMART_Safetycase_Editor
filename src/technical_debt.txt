NOT FOR MARCH:

- TODO: Modifications inside the graphical editors:
    - TODO: See if it is possible to auto-wrap the text in boxes in the graphical editors
- TODO: Look at putting in a check routine to cascade deletes... maybe. Uncontrolled
    that could accidentally wipe out an entire project and safe rules will be tricky.
- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
- TODO: "Undelete" and housekeeping functions from main menu
- TODO: DQ checking and issues system
- TODO: Library functions and object copy/paste


Functional

- TODO: ProjectWindow needs a query method to allow a check to see if it already
    has a tab for something that another form is going to try to open (e.g one of
    the hazard details forms from the bowtie). Otherwise we can end up with more
    than one editor form instance open for the same object.

- TODO NEXT: Update notifcications for process editor and generally from when a new
    instance of an object is created

- TODO: Error handling and reporting

- TODO: Reports

- TODO: Link editor link type list - Hannah to provide RelationshipSemantics list
    - TODO: Make sure the RelationshipSemantics is implemented and works for the 
            Link editor.
