High-level

- ERROR HANDLING AND REPORTING

- Need to add a housekeeping/purge function to get rid of "deleted" (i.e. records marked with a
    deleted date but still extant in the database) relationships, and another one for persistable
    objects. Probably constrained to current project.

- System/subsystem/function graphical editor in the style of the bowtie/process interfaces

- Reports. HTML editor integrated. Needs user refinement. Need to add report generator itself
    to assemble report content from the project data. Also to include the graphs.

- DQ checking and issues system


Functional

- Go through and tidy up the editor forms

- In Bowtie editor, save needs to add or update the list in the top table

- TODO NEXT: Integrate Sharif's system/function editor

- TODO: Add "About" screen (Hannah to provide some content)

- TODO: Probably need to detect name collisions within a set of child nodes in the tree.
